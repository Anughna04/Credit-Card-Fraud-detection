# Credit-card-Fraud-detection
## Overview 

This project is a credit card fraud detection system using Logistic Regression, built with Streamlit for easy interaction. The model is trained on an imbalanced dataset using SMOTE to balance classes and evaluated using classification metrics and ROC-AUC curves.

## 📌Features

✦ SMOTE to handle class imbalance,LogisticRegression for training

✦ Feature scaling with StandardScaler.

✦ Interactive UI using Streamlit.

✦ Fraud Time Analysis Graph for insights.

✦ Model validation using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.

✦ Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Classification Report, and ROC-AUC.
      
## 📈Performance Metrics

✦see the classification report and roc-auc graph in [fraud detection(credit card).ipynb].(fraud detection(credit card).ipynb).

| Metric           |   Score   |
|-------------------- |  ----------- |
| **Accuracy**     |   95.6%   |
| **F1-Score**     |   92.3%   |
| **ROC-AUC**      |    96.1%   |
